### The Defense of Logic

**Dear Dr. Benedictus,**

I am in receipt of your standard rejection template regarding my manuscript, *"Fazz-4 and the Altlama/Derzz Protocol..."*

I am writing this response not merely as an independent researcher, but as an **Attorney at Law** who has built his career on the principles of logic, causality, and proof.

#### 1. Procedural Invalidity ("Null and Void")
In the universal doctrine of law, a verdict issued without a written justification or reasoning is considered **"null and void ab initio" (yoklukla batıl)**. It holds no legal or logical validity. Similarly, in the realm of science, a "Desk Rejection" provided without a single technical critique, without pointing out a specific physical error, and without peer review, carries no scientific weight. It is procedurally invalid.

#### 2. The Vision Gap
My manuscript proposes a novel asymptotic framework that bridges Physical Limits with Artificial Intelligence—a paradigm shift that requires a multidisciplinary perspective. To reject such a comprehensive work based solely on a superficial assessment of its title or scope, without engaging with its mathematical core ($n(n+1)/2$), is not an act of scientific rigor; it is a profound **lack of vision**.

#### 3. Conclusion
Therefore, **I do not accept this rejection** as a scientific conclusion. A rejection without a premise is merely a bureaucratic opinion, not a falsification (Karl Popper).

If *Foundations of Physics* is unable to process a protocol that challenges the "Container Universe" model with computational proofs, the limitation lies not in my manuscript, but in the editorial board's reluctance to face the future of physics.

Consider this note as a formal objection to your procedural opacity.
